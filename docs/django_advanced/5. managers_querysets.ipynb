    "## Managers\n",
    "Managers in Django are a way to encapsulate database query operations for a model. They provide an interface through which database queries can be made, allowing for custom query methods and reusable query logic.\n",
    "By default, each Django model has a manager called `objects`, but you can define your own custom managers by extending `models.Manager`. Custom managers can include methods that return specific querysets or perform complex queries.\n",
    "Here's an example of how to create and use a custom manager in Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class PublishedManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "    def get_queryset(self):\n",
    "        return super().get_queryset().filter(status='published')\n",
    "        \n",
    "class Article(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n",
    "    content = models.TextField()\n",
    "    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=(('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published')))\n",
    "    objects = models.Manager()  # The default manager\n",
    "    published = PublishedManager()  # Our custom manager\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "published_articles = Article.published.all()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we created a custom manager `PublishedManager` that filters articles with a status of 'published'. We then added this manager to the `Article` model, allowing us to easily retrieve published articles using `Article.published.all()`."

    "## QuerySets\n",
    "QuerySets in Django represent a collection of database queries that can be filtered, ordered, and manipulated. They are lazy, meaning that the actual database query is not executed until the data is needed. QuerySets can be created using the model's manager and can be chained together to build complex queries.\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use QuerySets in Django:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from myapp.models import Article\n",
    "# Retrieve all articles\n",
    "all_articles = Article.objects.all()\n",
    "# Filter articles by status\n",
    "published_articles = Article.objects.filter(status='published')\n",
    "# Order articles by title\n",
    "ordered_articles = Article.objects.order_by('title')\n",
    "# Chain filters and ordering\n",
    "recent_published_articles = Article.objects.filter(status='published').order_by('-created_at')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate how to retrieve all articles, filter them by status, order them by title, and chain multiple QuerySet methods to get recently published articles ordered by creation date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom QuerySets\n",
    "You can also create custom QuerySets by extending `models.QuerySet`. This allows you to define reusable query logic that can be applied to multiple models. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class ArticleQuerySet(models.QuerySet):\n",
    "    def published(self):\n",
    "        return self.filter(status='published')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Article(models.Model):\n",
    "    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n",
    "    content = models.TextField()\n",
    "    status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=(('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published')))\n",
    "    objects = ArticleQuerySet.as_manager()\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "published_articles = Article.objects.published()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we created a custom QuerySet `ArticleQuerySet` with a method `published` that filters articles by their published status. We then set this QuerySet as the manager for the `Article` model, allowing us to call `Article.objects.published()` to retrieve published articles."

    "### Managers vs QuerySets\n",
    "- **Managers** are used to define methods that return QuerySets and encapsulate database query logic.\n",
    "- **QuerySets** represent a collection of database queries and provide methods to filter, order, and manipulate the data.\n",
    "Both managers and QuerySets are essential for working with databases in Django, allowing for clean and efficient data retrieval and manipulation.\n",
    "- A **Manager** will always return a **QuerySet**, which is the actual collection of data retrieved from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Example, if you have a model `Book`, you can create a custom manager to get all books by a specific author, and a custom QuerySet to filter books published in a certain year. This modular approach helps keep your code organized and reusable.\n",

    "from django.db import models\n",

    "```\n",
    "In this example, we created a custom QuerySet `BookQuerySet` with a method to filter books by publication year, and a custom manager `BookManager` with a method to get books by author. This allows for clean and efficient querying of the `Book` model.\n",

    "### 1. Use Custom Managers for Business Logic\n",
    "Encapsulate complex query logic in custom managers to keep views and models clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ArticleManager(models.Manager):\n",

    "\n",
    "class Article(models.Model):\n",
    "    objects = ArticleManager()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Chain QuerySet Methods Efficiently\n",
    "Build complex queries by chaining methods, but be mindful of database performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Chain methods logically\n",
    "articles = Article.objects.filter(status=\"published\").select_related(\"author\").order_by(\"-published_at\")[:10]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Avoid: Multiple separate queries\n",
    "published = Article.objects.filter(status=\"published\")\n",
    "with_authors = published.select_related(\"author\")\n",
    "ordered = with_authors.order_by(\"-published_at\")\n",
    "limited = ordered[:10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use QuerySet Caching Wisely\n",
    "QuerySets are lazy, but once evaluated, they're cached. Reuse evaluated QuerySets when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_articles():\n",
    "    articles = Article.objects.filter(status=\"published\")  # Not evaluated yet\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # First evaluation - hits database\n",
    "    count = articles.count()\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Second evaluation - uses cache\n",
    "    for article in articles:\n",
    "        print(article.title)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Avoid N+1 Query Problems\n",
    "Always use `select_related` or `prefetch_related` for related objects in loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use `exists()` for Existence Checks\n",
    "Instead of `count() > 0`, use `exists()` which is more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if Article.objects.filter(title=\"My Title\").exists():\n",
    "    # Do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Be Careful with Large QuerySets\n",
    "For large datasets, use pagination or `iterator()` to avoid loading everything into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for article in Article.objects.iterator():\n",
    "    # Process one at a time\n",
