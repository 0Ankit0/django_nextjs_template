    "## DRF Access Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "`drf-access-policy` provides a way to define complex access rules for your Django Rest Framework APIs in a declarative, readable format. It is inspired by AWS IAM policies, allowing you to separate your permission logic from your views and models. This approach is significantly more maintainable than writing complex `if/else` chains in standard DRF permission classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use it?\n",
    "1.  **Declarative Syntax**: Permissions are defined as a list of statements, making them easy to read and audit.\n",
    "2.  **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps your ViewSets clean by moving permission logic to its own class.\n",
    "3.  **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Easily write rules based on object attributes (e.g., \"User can only edit if they are the owner\" or \"User can only publish if the article is in draft state\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "An `AccessPolicy` is a class that defines a `statements` list. Each statement rules on whether a request should be allowed or denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **action**: The ViewSet method(s) this rule applies to (e.g., `list`, `retrieve`, `create`, or custom actions).\n",
    "- **principal**: The user(s) this rule applies to (e.g., `*` for anyone, `authenticated` for logged-in users, `group:admin` for specific groups).\n",
    "- **effect**: `allow` or `deny`.\n",
    "- **condition** (optional): A list of custom methods to check for finer-grained control (e.g., `is_owner`)."

    "pipenv install drf-access-policy\n",

    "### Basic Usage Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, you create a policy class inheriting from `AccessPolicy` and assign it to your ViewSet's `permission_classes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Define the Policy\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from rest_framework_access_policy import AccessPolicy\n",
    "\n",
    "class ArticleAccessPolicy(AccessPolicy):\n",
    "    statements = [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"action\": [\"list\", \"retrieve\"],\n",
    "            \"principal\": \"*\",\n",
    "            \"effect\": \"allow\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"action\": [\"create\", \"update\"],\n",
    "            \"principal\": [\"authenticated\"],\n",
    "            \"effect\": \"allow\"\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"action\": [\"destroy\"],\n",
    "            \"principal\": [\"group:admin\"],\n",
    "            \"effect\": \"allow\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Apply to ViewSet\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from rest_framework import viewsets\n",
    "from .models import Article\n",
    "from .serializers import ArticleSerializer\n",
    "\n",
    "class ArticleViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):\n",
    "    queryset = Article.objects.all()\n",
    "    serializer_class = ArticleSerializer\n",
    "    permission_classes = (ArticleAccessPolicy,)\n",

    "### Custom Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditions are where `drf-access-policy` truly shines. You can define methods starting with `is_` (or others if configured) to check dynamic attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, ensuring a user can only edit their own articles:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class ArticleAccessPolicy(AccessPolicy):\n",
    "    statements = [\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"action\": [\"update\", \"partial_update\"],\n",
    "            \"principal\": [\"authenticated\"],\n",
    "            \"effect\": \"allow\",\n",
    "            \"condition\": [\"is_owner\"]\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        # ... other rules\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    def is_owner(self, request, view, action) -> bool:\n",
    "        # Retrieve the specific object being accessed\n",
    "        # Note: view.get_object() triggers a database query.\n",
    "        article = view.get_object()\n",
    "        return request.user == article.author\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Scoping QuerySets\n",
    "\n",
    "Access policies can also easily filter the `get_queryset` method of your ViewSet to automatically restrict the data returned to the user, based on the same rules.\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Deny by Default**: If no statement matches, AccessPolicy denies access by default. Rely on this safety net.\n",
    "2.  **Order Matters**: Statements are evaluated in order. The first one that matches `action` and `principal` (and `condition`) determines the outcome. \n",
    "3.  **Keep Conditions Lightweight**: Remember that conditions stick to the request lifecycle. Avoid expensive operations if possible, or memoize them.\n",
    "4.  **Use `scope_queryset`**: Whenever possible, filter data at the database level using scope_queryset rather than fetching everything and permission-checking one by one."
