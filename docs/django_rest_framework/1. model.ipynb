    "The first step in creating backend is to create a proper model. A model represents the structure of the data that will be stored in the database and how different pieces of data relate to each other. Here are some key considerations when creating a backend model:\n",
    "1. **Identify Entities**: Determine the main entities that need to be represented in the model. For example, in an e-commerce application, entities might include Users, Products, Orders, and Categories.\n",
    "2. **Define Attributes**: For each entity, define the attributes that describe it. For example, a User entity might have attributes like username, email, password, and date of birth.\n",
    "3. **Establish Relationships**: Determine how entities relate to each other. For example, a User can place multiple Orders, and each Order can contain multiple Products. This involves defining one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationships.\n",
    "4. **Normalization**: Ensure that the model is normalized to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. This may involve breaking down entities into smaller related entities.\n",
    "5. **Data Types**: Choose appropriate data types for each attribute based on the nature of the data (e.g., string, integer, date, boolean).\n",
    "6. **Constraints and Validation**: Define any constraints or validation rules for the attributes, such as required fields, unique values, or value ranges.\n",
    "7. **Indexes**: Consider adding indexes to frequently queried fields to improve performance.\n",
    "8. **Scalability**: Design the model with scalability in mind, anticipating future growth and changes in data requirements.\n",
    "9. **Documentation**: Document the model thoroughly, including entity definitions, relationships, and any business rules that apply.\n",
    "10. **Review and Iterate**: Review the model with stakeholders and iterate based on feedback to ensure it meets the application's needs.\n",
    "By carefully considering these aspects, you can create a robust backend model that effectively supports the application's functionality and performance requirements."

    "## Class based model Methods and classes\n",
    "Django provides several built-in methods and classes that can be used to define and manipulate models. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:\n",
    "1. **Model Class**: The base class for all Django models. All models should inherit from `django.db.models.Model`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "   class MyModel(models.Model):\n",
    "       # fields go here\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Field Classes**: Django provides various field classes to define the attributes of a model, such as `CharField`, `IntegerField`, `DateTimeField`, etc.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "   age = models.IntegerField()\n",
    "   created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Meta Class**: A nested class within a model that provides metadata options, such as ordering, verbose name, and database table name.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Meta:\n",
    "       ordering = ['name']\n",
    "       verbose_name = 'My Model'\n",
    "       db_table = 'my_model_table'\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The different attributes that can be defined in Meta class are:\n",
    "   - `ordering`: Specifies the default ordering for query results.\n",
    "   - `verbose_name`: A human-readable name for the model.\n",
    "   - `db_table`: The name of the database table to use for the model.\n",
    "   - `unique_together`: A set of field names that must be unique together.\n",
    "   - `indexes`: A list of database indexes to create for the model.\n",
    "   - `index_together`: A set of field names that should be indexed together for performance.\n",
    "   - `permissions`: A list of custom permissions for the model.\n",
    "   - `abstract`: If set to True, the model will be an abstract base class.\n",
    "   - `app_label`: Specifies the application label for the model. The default is the name of the app containing the model.\n",
    "   - `db_tablespace`: Specifies the database tablespace to use for the model's table. It is useful for databases that support tablespaces.\n",
    "   - `default_related_name`: Specifies the default name to use for the reverse relation from related models.\n",
    "   - `default_manager_name`: Specifies the name of the default manager for the model.\n",
    "   - `get_latest_by`: Specifies the field to use for the `latest()` and `earliest()` methods. These methods return the latest or earliest object based on the specified field.\n",
    "   - `managed`: If set to False, Django will not create or delete the database table for this model. This is useful for models that represent database views or legacy tables.\n",
    "   - `default_permissions`: A tuple of the default permissions to create for the model. The default is ('add', 'change', 'delete', 'view'). The permissions will be created in the format <app_label>.<permission>_<model_name>.\n",
    "   - `constraints`: A list of database constraints to apply to the model. Constraints can be used to enforce data integrity at the database level.\n",
    "4. **save() Method**: A method used to save an instance of a model to the database.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   instance = MyModel(name='John', age=30)\n",
    "   instance.save()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You can also override this method to add custom behavior when saving a model instance.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "       # custom behavior here\n",
    "       super().save(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **delete() Method**: A method used to delete an instance of a model from the database.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   instance.delete()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   You can also override this method to add custom behavior when deleting a model instance.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):\n",
    "         # custom behavior here\n",
    "         super().delete(*args, **kwargs)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **__str__() Method**: A special method that defines the string representation of a model instance.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def __str__(self):\n",
    "       return self.name\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "7. **get_absolute_url() Method**: A method that returns the canonical URL for a model instance.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def get_absolute_url(self):\n",
    "       return f\"/mymodel/{self.id}/\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This method is often used in conjunction with Django's URL routing system to provide a consistent way to access model instances via URLs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "8. **Manager Class**: The default manager for a model, which provides methods for querying the database. You can also create custom managers by inheriting from `models.Manager`.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class MyModelManager(models.Manager):\n",
    "       def active(self):\n",
    "           return self.filter(is_active=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   There the active method can be used as:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   MyModel.objects.active()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   It will return all the active objects of MyModel without writing the filter code again and again.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **QuerySet Class**: Represents a collection of database queries. You can chain methods to filter, order, and manipulate the data.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   MyModel.objects.filter(age__gte=18).order_by('name')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "These methods and classes provide a powerful way to define and interact with your Django models, allowing you to create robust and flexible data structures for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Field Options\n",
    "Common arguments available to all field types:\n",
    "- `null`: If `True`, Django stores empty values as NULL in the database. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- `blank`: If `True`, the field is allowed to be blank in forms. Default is `False`.\n",
    "- `choices`: A sequence of 2-tuples to use as choices for this field.\n",
    "- `default`: The default value for the field.\n",
    "- `help_text`: Extra \"help\" text to be displayed with the form widget.\n",
    "- `primary_key`: If `True`, this field is the primary key for the model.\n",
    "- `unique`: If `True`, this field must be unique throughout the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relationships\n",
    "Django offers three types of database relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Many-to-One (ForeignKey)\n",
    "Used when a model belongs to another model.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(models.Model):\n",
    "    manufacturer = models.ForeignKey(Manufacturer, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Many-to-Many (ManyToManyField)\n",
    "Used when a model can relate to multiple instances of another model and vice versa.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Pizza(models.Model):\n",
    "    toppings = models.ManyToManyField(Topping)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. One-to-One (OneToOneField)\n",
    "Used when a model instance relates to exactly one instance of another model.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class UserProfile(models.Model):\n",
    "    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Inheritance\n",
    "Django supports three styles of model inheritance:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Classes**: Used when you want parent's fields to be used in child models, but don't want a table for the parent.\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class CommonInfo(models.Model):\n",
    "       name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n",
    "       age = models.PositiveIntegerField()\n",
    "\n",
    "       class Meta:\n",
    "           abstract = True\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. **Multi-table Inheritance**: Used when you want each model to have its own table.\n",
    "3. **Proxy Models**: Used to change the behavior of a model (e.g., default ordering) without changing the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real World Example: E-commerce Product\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Product(models.Model):\n",
    "    CATEGORY_CHOICES = [\n",
    "        ('ELEC', 'Electronics'),\n",
    "        ('CLOTH', 'Clothing'),\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, db_index=True)\n",
    "    slug = models.SlugField(unique=True)\n",
    "    category = models.CharField(max_length=5, choices=CATEGORY_CHOICES)\n",
    "    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)\n",
    "    description = models.TextField(blank=True)\n",
    "    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)\n",
    "    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        ordering = ['-created_at']\n",
    "        verbose_name_plural = 'Products'\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return self.name\n",

    "### Custom Properties and Methods\n",
    "You can add custom properties and methods to your model class to encapsulate business logic related to that model. For example, you might add a method to calculate the full name of a user or a property to check if a product is in stock. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "        self.price -= discount_amount\n",
    "        self.save()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the `Product` model has a property `is_in_stock` that checks if the product is available in stock, and a method `apply_discount` that applies a discount to the product's price."
