    "## URLs\n",
    "In Django the `urls.py` file is used to define URL patterns for routing HTTP requests to the appropriate views. It acts as a mapping between URL paths and the corresponding view functions or class-based views that handle those requests. There are basically mainly two ways to define URL patterns in Django:\n",
    "1. **Using `path()` and `re_path()` functions**: This is the traditional way of defining URL patterns in Django. You manually specify each URL pattern and map it to a view.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    from django.urls import path\n",
    "    from . import views\n",
    "    urlpatterns = [\n",
    "        path('users/', views.user_list, name='user_list'),\n",
    "        path('users/<int:id>/', views.user_detail, name='user_detail'),\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **Using Routers with Viewsets**: This is a more automated way of defining URL patterns, especially when using Django REST Framework. Routers automatically generate URL patterns for viewsets, which are classes that combine the logic for a set of related views.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter\n",
    "    from .views import UserViewSet\n",
    "    router = DefaultRouter()\n",
    "    router.register(r'users', UserViewSet, basename='user')\n",
    "    urlpatterns = router.urls\n",
    "```"
