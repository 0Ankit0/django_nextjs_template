# Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Django Template project. The system is designed to provide a robust, scalable foundation for applications with built-in multi-tenancy, authentication, payments, and API capability.

## 2. Problem Statement
Developers building applications often spend significant time reinventing the wheel by implementing authentication, subscription management, and multi-tenancy logic. This platform aims to solve this by providing a production-ready boilerplate.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Authentication & Identity Management
- **User Registration**: Users must be able to sign up using email/password or social providers (Google, Facebook).
- **Login/Logout**: Secure session management.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users can enable OTP-based 2FA for enhanced security.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal details and avatar.

### 3.2 Multi-Tenancy (Organizations/Teams)
- **Tenant Creation**: Users can create organizations (Tenants).
- **Membership Management**: Tenant owners can invite other users via email.
- **Roles**: Support for different roles within a tenant (Owner, Admin, Member).
- **Data Isolation**: All application data must be scoped to the active tenant.

### 3.3 Subscription & Billing (Finances)
- **Stripe Integration**: Seamless integration with Stripe for payments.
- **Plans**: Support for multiple pricing tiers (Products/Prices).
- **Subscription Management**: Users can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel subscriptions.
- **Invoicing**: Automatic invoice generation and billing email management.

### 3.4 API & Integration
- **REST API**: Comprehensive API endpoints for all core resources.
- **Webhooks**: Handling Stripe webhooks for subscription status updates.
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for developers.

### 3.5 Real-time Features
- **Notifications**: In-app notifications for important events (invites, billing).
- **WebSockets**: Infrastructure to support real-time updates.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling increasing numbers of tenants and users.
- **Security**: Compliance with best practices (CSRF protection, secure cookies, password hashing).
- **Performance**: Efficient database queries and caching strategies (Redis).
- **Maintainability**: Modular app structure (Django apps) and type hinting.

## 5. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Django, Django REST Framework.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Production), SQLite (Local).
- **Async Tasks**: Celery, Redis.
- **Frontend**: Django Templates + Tailwind CSS (or decoupled frontend).
- **Payments**: Stripe (via dj-stripe).
